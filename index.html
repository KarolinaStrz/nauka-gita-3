    	<h1> Moja piosenka </h1>
    	<p>I found a love for me
			Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
			I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
			I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

			Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
			Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
			But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
			And in your eyes you’re holding mine

			Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
			Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
			When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
			But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight</p>
