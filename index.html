    			<p class="song verse-1">I found a love for me
				Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
				I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
				I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>

				<p class="song verse-2">Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
				Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
				But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
				And in your eyes you’re holding mine</p>

				<p class="song verse-ref">Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
				Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
				When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
				But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight</p>
				
				<p class="song verse-3">Well I found a woman,stronger than anyone I know
				She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I’ll share her home
				I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
				To carry love, to carry children of our own
				We are still kids, but we’re so in love, fighting against all odds
				I know we’ll be alright this time
				Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I’ll be your man
				I see my future in your eyes</p>

				<p class="song verse-ref">Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
				Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
				When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
				I don’t deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight</p>

				<p class="song verse-ref">Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
				Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
				I have faith in what I see
				Now I know I have met an angel in person
				And she looks perfect, I don’t deserve this
				You look perfect tonight</p>
