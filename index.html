    	<h1> Moja piosenka </h1>
    	<p>I found a love for me
			Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
			I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
			I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

			Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
			Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
			But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
			And in your eyes you’re holding mine

			Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
			Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
			When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
			But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
			
			Well I found a woman,stronger than anyone I know
			She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I’ll share her home
			I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
			To carry love, to carry children of our own
			We are still kids, but we’re so in love, fighting against all odds
			I know we’ll be alright this time
			Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I’ll be your man
			I see my future in your eyes

			Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
			Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
			When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
			I don’t deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

			Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
			Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
			I have faith in what I see
			Now I know I have met an angel in person
			And she looks perfect, I don’t deserve this
			You look perfect tonight
